We welcome contributions, however you should react out in a [github issue](https://github.com/revsys/django-health-check/issues) before spending considerable time implementing a
new feature or check to ensure it's something we would be willing to accept.

We don't want anyone wasting time on something that doesn't seem to fit with
the goals of the project.

more information you can provide the better, but at a minimum you should include
the following information:

- Version of Python in use

- Anything else you think may be useful to us in debuggin it

discuss on a Github issue, please [email us](mailto:frank@revsys.com)
